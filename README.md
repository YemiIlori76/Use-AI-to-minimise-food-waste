# Use-AI-to-minimise-food-waste

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
By overcoming challenges such as data integration, cost and employee engagement, organisations can successfully use AI to reduce food waste. This not only increases operational efficiency and profitability, but also contributes to achieving sustainability goals and creates long-term value for the organisation and the environment.

## Background: Food waste is a major problem in the global food industry and represents both an economic and an environmental challenge. The extent of food waste in food production, especially in bakeries and large food manufacturing plants, is considerable. Food waste occurs at various stages, from the procurement of raw materials to production, packaging and distribution. For bakeries and food manufacturers, the problem often lies in overproduction caused by inaccurate demand forecasting and inefficient production planning.

## How is it used?
AI is being used in multiple ways to help minimize food waste in bakeries and large food manufacturers. The key areas where AI is making an impact include:

Predicting demand more accurately to avoid overproduction.
Optimizing production schedules to align with real-time demand.
Detecting waste early using computer vision and sensors.
Managing inventory to ensure raw materials and products are used efficiently.
Implementing dynamic pricing to encourage the sale of perishable goods before they spoil.
Optimizing the supply chain to reduce delays and spoilage.
As these AI techniques continue to mature, they hold great potential for further reducing waste, improving efficiency, and contributing to a more sustainable food industry.

## Data sources and AI methods
The most important role of AI in minimising food waste starts with accurately predicting demand. Predictive analytics is a branch of AI that uses historical data to make predictions about future events. Key techniques include:

Time series prediction: this technique uses historical sales data to predict future demand trends. Time series models such as ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average), Exponential Smoothing and more advanced methods such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks (a type of recurrent neural network, RNN) can be used to predict demand at different time intervals (e.g. daily or hourly).

Regression models: These models are used to predict demand based on continuous data such as weather, public holidays or local events. Techniques such as linear regression or random forest regression can be used to identify relationships between external factors and product sales.

Machine learning (ML) to predict demand: More sophisticated machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) and XGBoost can be used to predict demand with higher accuracy by learning from large, complex data sets. These models can handle multiple variables and capture non-linear relationships that simpler models may miss.

Neural networks and deep learning: For highly complex data sets, deep neural networks (DNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to recognise patterns in demand data, especially when there are non-linear dependencies between different influencing factors (e.g. the combination of weather, day of the week and regional preferences).

B. Production optimisation and scheduling
Once demand is predicted, optimising the production schedule to match demand is critical to reducing waste. AI techniques can help ensure that production is dynamically adjusted to avoid over or under production:

Integer Linear Programming (ILP): ILP is used to optimise production schedules by determining the best way to allocate limited resources (e.g. machines, raw materials) to maximise efficiency and minimise waste. This can help a bakery produce the right amount of each product based on projected demand while avoiding overproduction.

Reinforcement learning (RL): RL algorithms can be used for real-time optimisation of production schedules. An RL agent learns by interacting with the production environment and receiving feedback (rewards or punishments) based on its actions. Over time, it learns how to adjust production rates and schedules to minimise waste while meeting demand.

Genetic Algorithms (GAs): These optimisation techniques mimic the process of natural evolution and can be used to optimise complex production planning problems. For example, they can help to balance production across multiple product lines, taking into account constraints such as the availability of raw materials and machine downtime.

C. Inventory management and waste detection
Effective inventory management can help ensure that raw materials are utilised efficiently and waste due to overstocking or spoilage is avoided. AI can improve inventory management by integrating real-time data and predictive modelling:

Predictive inventory models: machine learning models can predict when overstocking of raw materials or finished goods is likely to occur. This ensures that production plans are adjusted to minimise overstocking and prevent spoilage.

Computer vision for quality control: Computer vision can be used to detect imperfections or defects in products on production lines. This is particularly useful in bakeries, where products such as bread and pastries can be deformed or damaged. AI models based on machine vision can inspect and sort products and mark those that should be discarded or reused before they are packaged.

Sensor data and IoT: Internet of Things (IoT) sensors combined with AI can monitor conditions for perishable products. For example, sensors can monitor the temperature and humidity in storage rooms and AI can use this data to predict the deterioration of products so that manufacturers can optimise storage conditions and reduce spoilage.

D. Dynamic pricing and discounting
AI can also be used to reduce wastage by dynamically pricing perishable products to encourage customers to buy before the expiry date is reached:

Dynamic pricing models: AI-driven pricing algorithms adjust the price of perishable goods based on their remaining shelf life and demand patterns. Reinforcement learning can help optimise pricing in real time and offer discounts on items that are close to their expiry date while maximising overall sales.

Price optimisation: Machine learning algorithms such as gradient boosting or neural networks can analyse past sales data, consumer behaviour and price elasticity to adjust prices for baked goods or packaged foods to strike a balance between waste reduction and profit maximisation.

## Challenges
While AI is a promising approach to reducing food waste in the food industry, its successful implementation comes with a number of challenges. These include the need for high-quality, integrated data, the cost and complexity of implementation, the adaptability of AI models to different environments and overcoming resistance to change. Overcoming these challenges requires investment in infrastructure, staff training, data integration and a commitment to long-term collaboration between technology providers and food manufacturers.

Overcoming these obstacles requires a step-by-step approach, starting with smaller, easy-to-use AI applications (e.g. demand forecasting) and gradually expanding to more complex systems (e.g. dynamic pricing and full production optimisation). With the right approach, AI can transform the food industry and make it more sustainable, efficient and waste-free.
## What next?
By taking these steps — starting with data integration, selecting the right AI use cases, testing and scaling applications, and focusing on ethical and sustainable practises — bakeries and large food manufacturers can significantly reduce food waste. As AI technologies evolve and the data ecosystem improves, AI's impact on reducing food waste will only grow, helping businesses become more efficient, sustainable and profitable.

In the future, AI not only has the potential to minimise food waste, but also to create new opportunities for food companies to optimise operations throughout the supply chain. By utilising AI, companies are able to stay one step ahead of market demands and environmental regulations, positively impacting their bottom line and the planet.
